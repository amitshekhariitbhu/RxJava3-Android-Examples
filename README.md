# RxJava3-Android-Examples - Learn RxJava3 for Android by Examples

## [Outcome School Blog](https://outcomeschool.com/blog) - High-quality content to learn Android concepts.

### This project is for: 
* who is migrating to RxJava 3 from RxJava 2 
* who is just getting started with RxJava

### Just Build the project and start learning RxJava 3 by examples.

# RxJava 3 Operators Examples present in this sample project
* `Map` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item
* `Zip` -> combine the emissions of multiple Observables together via a specified function and emit single items for each combination based on the results of this function
* `Filter` -> emit only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test
* `Concat` -> emit the emissions from two or more Observables without interleaving them
* `Merge` -> combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions
* `SwitchMap` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, and mirror those items emitted by the most-recently transformed Observable
* `timer` -> do something after a span of time that we specify
* `delay` -> shift the emissions from an Observable forward in time by a particular amount
* `debounce` -> only emit an item from an Observable if a particular timespan has passed without it emitting another item
* `distinctUntilChanged` -> suppress duplicate items emitted by an Observable
